<img class="profile-picture" src="{{site.profile-picture}}">

I'm currently working as a Hardware Systems Engineer for [Meta](https://www.meta.com). I've worked in the tech sector in a varity of positions: from software engineer to CTO.

I've been a founder twice. Once for SIM, a now defunct startup doing computer vision applied to materials science. The second time for [Pillar](https://pillar.fi), an Ethereum wallet.

Computer vision was a big thing at some point of my career. I've worked for a couple years on [SPRING](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring/), an open source GIS with great image processing features. I've also done a stint working with biometrics, fingerprints in particular. I have been out of the ML game for a while, but I'm currently enrolled in the [Cognitive Systems MSc](https://www.ouc.ac.cy/index.php/en/studies/programs/master/cos) from the OUC.

I've wrote a bunch of blockchain-related stuff at some point. I'm no longer interested in the space.

I'm occasionally contacted for freelance consulting. I don't have bandwidth to handle those anymore.
