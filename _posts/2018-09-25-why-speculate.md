   WHY SPECULATE?

   A talk by Michael Crichton (R.I.P., 2008)
   International Leadership Forum, La Jolla
   26 April 2002

       There are two times in a man's life when he should not
       speculate: when he can't afford it and when he can.
	   -- Mark Twain

   My topic for today is the prevalence of speculation in media.
   What does it mean? Why has it become so ubiquitous? Should we
   do something about it? If so, what? And why? Should we care at
   all? Isn't speculation valuable? Isn't it natural? And so on.

   I will join this speculative trend and speculate about why there
   is so much speculation. In keeping with the trend, I will try
   to express my views without any factual support, simply providing
   you with a series of bald assertions.

   This is not my natural style, and it's going to be a challenge
   for me, but I will do my best. Some of you may see that I have
   written out my talk, which is already a contradiction of principle.
   To keep within the spirit of our time, it should really be off
   the top of my head.

   Before we begin, I'd like to clarify a definition. By the media
   I mean movies, television, Internet, books, newspapers and
   magazines. Again, in keeping with the general trend of speculation,
   let's not make too many fine distinctions.

   First we might begin by asking, to what degree has the media
   turned to pure speculation? Someone could do a study of this and
   present facts, but nobody has. I certainly won't. There's no
   reason to bother. The requirement that you demonstrate a factual
   basis for your claim vanished long ago. It went out with the
   universal praise for Susan Faludi's book Backlash, which won the
   National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction in
   1991, and which presented hundreds of pages of quasi-statistical
   assertions based on a premise that was never demonstrated and
   that was almost certainly false.

   But that's old news. I merely refer to it now to set standards.

   Today, of course everybody knows that "Hardball," "Rivera Live"
   and similar shows are nothing but a steady stream of guesses
   about the future. The Sunday morning talk shows are pure
   speculation. They have to be. Everybody knows there's no news
   on Sunday.

   But television is entertainment. Let's look at the so-called
   serious media. For example, here is The New York Times for March
   6, the day Dick Farson told me I was giving this talk. The column
   one story for that day concerns Bush's tariffs on imported steel.
   Now we read: Mr.  Bush's action "is likely to send the price of
   steel up sharply, perhaps as much as ten percent..." American
   consumers "will ultimately bear" higher prices. America's allies
   "would almost certainly challenge" the decision. Their legal
   case "could take years to litigate in Geneva, is likely to hinge"
   on thus and such.

   Also note the vague and hidden speculation. The Allies' challenge
   would be "setting the stage for a major trade fight with many
   of the same countries Mr. Bush is trying to hold together in the
   fractious coalition against terrorism." In other words, the story
   speculates that tariffs may rebound against the fight against
   terrorism.

   By now, under the Faludi Standard I have firmly established that
   media are hopelessly riddled with speculation, and we can go on
   to consider its ramifications.

   You may read this tariff story and think, what's the big deal?
   The story's not bad. Isn't it reasonable to talk about effects
   of current events in this way? I answer, absolutely not. Such
   speculation is a complete waste of time. It's useless. It's
   bullshit on the front page of the Times.

   The reason why it is useless, of course, is that nobody knows
   what the future holds.

   Do we all agree that nobody knows what the future holds? Or do
   I have to prove it to you? I ask this because there are some
   well-studied media effects which suggest that simply appearing
   in media provides credibility. There was a well-known series of
   excellent studies by Stanford researchers that have shown, for
   example, that children take media literally. If you show them a
   bag of popcorn on a television set and ask them what will happen
   if you turn the TV upside down, the children say the popcorn
   will fall out of the bag. This result would be amusing if it
   were confined to children. But the studies show that no one is
   exempt. All human beings are subject to this media effect,
   including those of us who think we are self-aware and hip and
   knowledgeable.

   Media carries with it a credibility that is totally undeserved.
   You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann
   Amnesia effect. (I refer to it by this name because I once
   discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous
   name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect,
   than it would otherwise have.)

   Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You
   open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well.
   In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the
   article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding
   of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong
   it actually presents the story backward -- reversing cause and
   effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's
   full of them.

   In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple
   errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or
   international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper
   was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you
   just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

   That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I'd point out it does not
   operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody
   consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount
   everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of
   falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one
   part, untruthful in all. But when it comes to the media, we
   believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to
   read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly
   isn't. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.

   So one problem with speculation is that it piggybacks on the
   Gell-Mann effect of unwarranted credibility, making the speculation
   look more useful than it is.

   Another issue concerns the sheer volume of speculation. Sheer
   volume comes to imply a value which is specious. I call this the
   There-Must-Be-A-Pony effect, from the old joke in which a kid
   comes down Christmas morning, finds the room filled with horseshit,
   and claps his hands with delight. His astonished parents ask:
   why are you so happy? He says, with this much horseshit, there
   must be a pony.

   Because we are confronted by speculation at every turn, in print,
   on video, on the net, in conversation, we may eventually conclude
   that it must have value. But it doesn't. Because no matter how
   many people are speculating, no matter how familiar their faces,
   how good their makeup and how well they are lit, no matter how
   many weeks they appear before us in person or in columns, it
   remains true that none of them knows what the future holds.

   Some people secretly believe that the future can be known. They
   imagine two groups of people that can know the future, and
   therefore should be listened to. The first is pundits. Since
   they expound on the future all the time, they must know what
   they are talking about. Do they? "Brill's Content" used to track
   the pundit's guesses, and while one or another had an occasional
   winning streak, over the long haul they did no better than chance.
   This is what you would expect. Because nobody knows the future.

   I want to mention in passing that punditry has undergone a subtle
   change over the years. In the old days, commentators such as
   Eric Sevareid spent most of their time putting events in a
   context, giving a point of view about what had already happened.
   Telling what they thought was important or irrelevant in the
   events that had already taken place. This is of course a legitimate
   function of expertise in every area of human knowledge.

   But over the years the punditic thrust has shifted away from
   discussing what has happened, to discussing what may happen. And
   here the pundits have no benefit of expertise at all. Worse,
   they may, like the Sunday politicians, attempt to advance one
   or another agenda by predicting its imminent arrival or demise.
   This is politicking, not predicting.

   The second group that some people imagine may know the future
   are specialists of various kinds. They don't, either. As a
   limiting case, I remind you there is a new kind of specialist
   occupation -- I refuse to call it a discipline, or a field of
   study -- called futurism. The notion here is that there is a way
   to study trends and know what the future holds. That would indeed
   be valuable, if it were possible. But it isn't possible. Futurists
   don't know any more about the future than you or I.  Read their
   magazines from a couple of years ago and you'll see an endless
   parade of error.

   Expertise is no shield against failure to see ahead. That's why
   it was Thomas Watson, head of IBM, who predicted the world only
   needed 4 or 5 computers. That is about as wrong a prediction as
   it is possible to make, by a man who had every reason to be
   informed about what he was talking about. Not only did he fail
   to anticipate a trend, or a technology, he failed to understand
   the myriad uses to which a general purpose machine might be put.
   Similarly, Paul Erlich, a brilliant academic who has devoted his
   entire life to ecological issues, has been wrong in nearly all
   his major predictions.

   He was wrong about diminishing resources, he was wrong about the
   population explosion, and he was wrong that we would lose 50%
   of all species by the year 2000. He devoted his life to intensely
   felt issues, yet he has been spectacularly wrong.

   All right, you may say, you'll accept that the future can't be
   known, in the way I am talking. But what about more immediate
   matters, such as the effects of pending legislation? Surely it
   is important to talk about what will happen if certain legislation
   passes. Well, no, it isn't. Nobody knows what is going to happen
   when the legislation passes. I give you two examples, one from
   the left and one from the right.

   The first is the Clinton welfare reform, harshly criticized by
   his own left wing for caving in to the Republican agenda. The
   left's predictions were for vast human suffering, shivering cold,
   child abuse, terrible outcomes. What happened? None of these
   things. Child abuse declined. In fact, as government reforms go,
   its been a success; but Mother Jones still predicts dire effects
   just ahead.

   This failure to predict the effects of a program was mirrored
   by the hysterical cries from the Republican right over raising
   the minimum wage. Chaos and dark days would surely follow as
   businesses closed their doors and the country was plunged into
   needless recession. But what was the actual effect? Basically,
   nothing. Who discusses it now?  Nobody. What will happen if there
   is an attempt to raise the minimum wage again? The same dire
   predictions all over again. Have we learned anything? No.

   But my point is, for pending legislation as with everything else,
   nobody knows the future.

   The same thing is true concerning the effect of elections and
   appointments. What will be the effect of electing a certain
   president, or a supreme court justice? Nobody knows. Some of you
   are old enough to remember Art Buchwald's famous column from the
   days of the Johnson Administration. Buchwald wrote a "Thank God
   we don't have Barry Goldwater" essay, recalling how everyone
   feared Goldwater would get us into a major war. So we elected
   Johnson, who promptly committed 200,000 troops to Vietnam. That's
   what happens when you choose the dove-ish candidate. You get a
   war. Or, you elect the intellectually brilliant Jimmy Carter,
   and watch as he ends up personally deciding who gets to use the
   White House tennis courts. Or you elect Richard Nixon because
   he can pull the plug on Vietnam, and he continues to fight for
   years.  And then opens China.

   Similarly, the history of the Supreme Court appointments is a
   litany of error in predicting how justices will vote once on the
   court. They don't all surprise us, but a lot of them do.

   So, in terms of imminent events, can we predict anything at all?
   No.  You need only look at what was said days before the Berlin
   Wall came down, to see nobody can predict even a few hours ahead.
   People said all sorts of silly things about the Communist empire
   just hours before its collapse. I can't quote them, because that
   would mean I had looked them up and had facts at hand, and I
   have promised you not to do that. But take my word for it, you
   can find silly statements 24 hours in advance.

   NOBODY KNOWS THE FUTURE.

   Now, this is not new information. It was Mark Twain who said,
   "I've seen a heap of trouble in my life, and most of it never
   came to pass."

   And much of what politicians say is not so much a prediction as
   an attempt to make it come true. It's argument disguised as
   analysis. But it doesn't really persuade anybody. Because most
   people can see through it.

   If speculation is worthless, why is there so much of it? Is it
   because people want it? I don't think so. I myself speculate
   that media has turned to speculation for media's own reasons.
   So now let's consider the advantages of speculation from a media
   standpoint.

    1. It's incredibly cheap. Talk is cheap. And speculation shows
       are the cheapest thing you can put on television, They're
       almost as cheap as running a test pattern. Speculation
       requires no research, no big staff. Minimal set. Just get
       the talking host, book the talking guests -- of which there
       is no shortage -- and you're done! Instant show. No reporters
       in different cities around the world, no film crews on
       location. No deadlines, no footage to edit, no editors...nothing!
       Just talk. Cheap.

    2. You can't lose. Even though the speculation is correct only
       by chance, which means you are wrong at least 50% of the
       time, nobody remembers and therefore nobody cares. You are
       never accountable.  The audience does not remember yesterday,
       let alone last week, or last month. Media exists in the
       eternal now, this minute, this crisis, this talking head,
       this column, this speculation.

   One of the clearest proofs of this is the Currents of Death
   controversy. It originated with the New Yorker, which has been
   a gushing fountainhead of erroneous scientific speculation for
   fifty years. But my point is this: many of the people who ten
   years ago were frantic to measure dangerous electromagnetic
   radiation in their houses now spend thousands of dollars buying
   magnets to attach to their wrists and ankles, because of the
   putative healthful effects of magnetic fields. These people don't
   remember these are the same magnetic fields they formerly wanted
   to avoid. And since they don't remember, as a speculator on
   media, you can't lose.

   Let me expand on this idea that you can't lose. It's not confined
   to the media. Most areas of intellectual life have discovered
   the virtues of speculation, and have embraced them wildly. In
   academia, speculation is usually dignified as theory. It's
   fascinating that even though the intellectual stance of the pomo
   deconstructionist era is against theory, particularly overarching
   theory, in reality what every academic wants to express is theory.

   This is in part aping science, but it's also an escape hatch.
   Your close textual reading of Jane Austen could well be found
   wrong, and could be shown to be wrong by a more knowledgeable
   antagonist. But your theory of radical feminization and authoritarian
   revolt in the work of Jane Austen is untouchable. Your view of
   the origins of the First World War could be debated by other
   authorities more meticulous than you. But your New Historicist
   essay, which might include your own fantasy about what it would
   be like if you were a soldier during the first war...  well,
   that's just unarguable.

   A wonderful area for speculative academic work is the unknowable.
   These days religious subjects are in disfavor, but there are
   still plenty of good topics. The nature of consciousness, the
   workings of the brain, the origin of aggression, the origin of
   language, the origin of life on earth, SETI and life on other
   worlds... this is all great stuff.  Wonderful stuff. You can
   argue it interminably. But it can't be contradicted, because
   nobody knows the answer to any of these topics -- and probably,
   nobody ever will.

   But that's not the only strategy one can employ. Because the
   media-educated public ignores and forgets past claims, these
   days even authors who present hard data are undamaged when the
   data is proven wrong. One of the most consistently wrong thinkers
   of recent years, Carol Gilligan of Harvard, once MS Magazine's
   Scientist of the Year, has had to retract (or modify) much of
   what she has ever written. Yet her reputation as a profound
   thinker and important investigator continues undiminished. You
   don't have to be right, any more. Nobody remembers.

   Then there is the speculative work of anthropologists like Helen
   Fisher, who claim to tell us about the origins of love or of
   infidelity or cooperation by reference to other societies, animal
   behavior, and the fossil record. How can she be wrong? It's
   untestable, unprovable, just so stories.

   And lest anyone imagine things are different in the hard sciences,
   consider string theory, for nearly twenty years now the dominant
   physical theory. More than one generation of physicists has
   labored over string theory. But -- if I understand it correctly,
   and I may not -- string theory cannot be tested or proven or
   disproven. Although some physicists are distressed by the argument
   that an untestable theory is nevertheless scientific, who is
   going to object, really? Face it, an untestable theory is ideal!
   Your career is secure!

   In short, the understanding that so long as you speculate, you
   can't lose is widespread. And it is perfect for the information
   age, which promises a cornucopia of knowledge, but delivers a
   cornucopia of snake oil.

   Now, nowhere is it written that the media need be accurate, or
   useful.  They haven't been for most or recorded history. So, now
   they're speculating... so what? What is wrong with it?

    1. Tendency to excess. The fact that it's only talk makes drama
       and spectacle unlikely -- unless the talk becomes heated and
       excessive.  So it becomes excessive. Not every show features
       the Crossfire-style food fight, but it is a tendency on all
       shows.

    2. "Crisisization" of everything possible. Most speculation is
       not compelling because most events are not compelling--Gosh,
       I wonder what will happen to the German Mark? Are they going
       to get their labor problems under control? This promotes the
       well-known media need for a crisis. Crisis in the German
       mark! Uh-oh! Look out!  Crises unite the country, draw viewers
       in large numbers, and give something to speculate about.
       Without a crisis, the talk soon degenerates into debate about
       whether the refs should have used instant replay on that
       last football game. So there is a tendency to hype urgency
       and importance and be-there-now when such reactions are
       really not appropriate. Witness the interminable scroll at
       the bottom of the screen about the Queen Mother's funeral.
       Whatever the Queen mother's story may be, it is not a crisis.
       I even watched a scroll of my own divorce roll by for a
       couple of days on CNN. It's sort of flattering, even though
       they got it wrong. But my divorce is surely not vital breaking
       news.

    3. Superficiality as a norm. Gotta go fast. Hit the high points.
       Speculation adds to the superficiality. That's it, don't you
       think?

    4. Endless presentation of uncertainty and conflict may interfere
       with resolution of issues. There is some evidence that the
       television food fights not only don't represent the views
       of most people -- who are not so polarized -- but they may
       tend to make resolution of actual disputes more difficult
       in the real world. At the very least, these food fights
       obscure the recognition that disputes are resolved every
       day. Compromise is much easier from relatively central
       positions than it is from extreme and hostile, conflicting
       positions: Greenpeace Spikers vs the Logging Industry.

    5. The interminable chains of speculation paves the way to
       litigation about breast implants, hysteria over Y2K and
       global warming, articles in The New Yorker about currents
       of death, and a variety of other results that are not, by
       any thoughtful view, good things to happen. There comes to
       be a perception -- convenient to the media -- that nothing
       is, in the end, knowable for sure. When in fact, that's not
       true.

   Let me point to a demonstrable bad effect of the assumption that
   nothing is really knowable. Whole word reading was introduced
   by the education schools of the country without, to my knowledge,
   any testing of the efficacy of the new method. It was simply put
   in place.  Generations of teachers were indoctrinated in its
   methods. As a result, the US has one of the highest illiteracy
   rates in the industrialized world. The assumption that nothing
   can be known with certainty does have terrible consequences.

   As GK Chesterton said (in a somewhat different context), "If you
   believe in nothing you'll believe in anything." That's what we
   see today. People believe in anything.

   But just in terms of the general emotional tenor of life, I often
   think people are nervous, jittery in this media climate of what
   if, what if, maybe, perhaps, could be -- when there is simply
   no reason to feel nervous. Like a bearded nut in robes on the
   sidewalk proclaiming the end of the world is near, the media is
   just doing what makes it feel good, not reporting hard facts.
   We need to start seeing the media as a bearded nut on the sidewalk,
   shouting out false fears. It's not sensible to listen to it.

   We need to start remembering that everybody who said that Y2K
   wasn't a real problem was either shouted down, or kept off the
   air. The same thing is true now of issues like species extinction
   and global warming.  You never hear anyone say it's not a crisis.
   I won't go into it, because it might lead to the use of facts,
   but I'll just mention two reports I speculate you haven't heard
   about. The first is the report in Science magazine January 18
   2001 (Oops! a fact) that contrary to prior studies, the Antarctic
   ice pack is increasing, not decreasing, and that this increase
   means we are finally seeing an end to the shrinking of the pack
   that has been going on for thousands of years, ever since the
   Holocene era. I don't know which is more surprising, the statement
   that it's increasing, or the statement that its shrinkage has
   preceded global warming by thousands of years.

   The second study is a National Academy of Sciences report on the
   economic effects to the US economy of the last El Nino warming
   event of 1997. That warming produced a net benefit of 15 billion
   dollars to the economy. That's taking into account 1.5 billion
   loss in California from rain, which was offset by decreased fuel
   bills for a milder winter, and a longer growing season. Net
   result 15 billion in increased productivity.

   The other thing I will mention to you is that during the last
   100 years, while the average temperature on the globe has increased
   just .3 C, the magnetic field of the earth declined by 10%. This
   is a much larger effect than global warming and potentially far
   more serious to life on this planet. Our magnetic field is what
   keeps the atmosphere in place. It is what deflects lethal radiation
   from space. A reduction of the earth's magnetic field by ten
   percent is extremely worrisome.

   But who is worried? Nobody. Who is raising a call to action?
   Nobody.  Why not? Because there is nothing to be done. How this
   may relate to global warming I leave for you to speculate on
   your own time.

   Personally, I think we need to start turning away from media,
   and the data shows that we are, at least from television news.
   I find that whenever I lack exposure to media I am much happier,
   and my life feels fresher.

   In closing, I'd remind you that while there are some things we
   cannot know for sure, there are many things that can be resolved,
   and indeed are resolved. Not by speculation, however. By careful
   investigation, by rigorous statistical analysis. Since we're
   awash in this contemporary ocean of speculation, we forget that
   things can be known with certainty, and that we need not live
   in a fearful world of interminable unsupported opinion. But the
   gulf that separates hard fact from speculation is by now so
   unfamiliar that most people can't comprehend it. I can perhaps
   make it clear by this story:

   On a plane to Europe, I am seated next to a guy who is very
   unhappy.  Turns out he is a doctor who has been engaged in a
   two-year double blind study of drug efficacy for the FDA, and
   it may be tossed out the window. Now a double-blind study means
   there are four separate research teams, each having no contact
   with any other team -- preferably, they're at different universities,
   in different parts of the country. The first team defines the
   study and makes up the medications, the real meds and the controls.
   The second team administers the medications to the patients. The
   third team comes in at the end and independently assesses the
   effect of the medications on each patient. The fourth team takes
   the data and does a statistical analysis. The cost of this kind
   of study, as you might imagine, is millions of dollars. And the
   teams must never meet.

   My guy is unhappy because months after the study is over, he in
   the waiting room of Frankfurt airport and he strikes up a
   conversation with another man in the lounge, and they discover
   -- to their horror -- that they are both involved in the study.
   My guy was on the team that administered the meds. The other guy
   is on the team doing the statistics. There isn't any reason why
   one should influence the other at this late date, but nevertheless
   the protocol requires that team members never meet. So now my
   guy is waiting to hear if the FDA will throw out the entire
   study, because of this chance meeting in Frankfurt airport.

   Those are the lengths you have to go to if you want to be certain
   that your information is correct. But when I tell people this
   story, they just stare at me incomprehendingly. They find it
   absurd. They don't think it's necessary to do all that. They
   think it's overkill. They live in the world of MSNBC and The New
   York Times. And they've forgotten what real, reliable information
   is, and the lengths you have to go to get it. It's so much harder
   than just speculating.

   And on that point, I have to agree with them.

   Thank you very much.
