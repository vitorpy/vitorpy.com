My background weaves through the tech sector. I've worn many hats, from software engineer to CTO. While I'm ashamed to admit it, I even worked for a VC for a while. I'm sorry.

I've also been a founder a few times. My first venture, SIM, applied computer vision to materials science (though it's no longer around). The second was [Pillar](https://pillar.fi), an Ethereum wallet.

I spent a couple years on [SPRING](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring/), an open source GIS with fantastic image processing capabilities. Biometrics, particularly fingerprints, also piqued my interest for a while. It was a fun challange, and I even have a [few old projects](https://github.com/vitorpy/qwsqviewer) from that time on GitHub.

Since 2017 (with a brief detour at Big Tech!), blockchain projects have become a major focus. Decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized identity are areas I'm particularly passionate about.
