I've worked in the tech sector in a varity of positions: from software engineer to CTO.

I've been a founder a couple times. Once for SIM, a now defunct startup doing computer vision applied to materials science. The second time for [Pillar](https://pillar.fi), an Ethereum wallet.

Computer vision was a big thing at some point of my career. I've worked for a couple years on [SPRING](http://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring/), an open source GIS with great image processing features. I've also done a stint working with biometrics, fingerprints in particular.

I'm occasionally contacted for freelance consulting. I don't have bandwidth to handle those anymore - unless you got something that really excites me.
