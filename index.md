I'm currently exploring how to build better trading venues with privacy tech at [Darklake](https://darklake.fi).

Previously, I've worn many hats, from software engineer to CTO. I have been a founder a few times. My first venture, SIM, applied computer vision to materials science. The second was [Pillar](https://pillar.fi), an Ethereum wallet.

Over my life, I worked on [GIS](https://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring/), [biometrics](https://github.com/vitorpy/qwsqviewer), computer vision, hardware, and plenty of random fields.

I was born in Brazil, and I'm currently living in Poland.

I'm a big fan of [Moxie Marlinspike](https://moxie.org) words: "In general, I hope to contribute to a world where we value skills and relationships over careers and money, where we know better than to trust cops or politicians, and where we're passionate about building and creating things in a self-motivated and self-directed way."
