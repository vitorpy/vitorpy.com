I'm currently building fairer trading venues with privacy tech at [Darklake](https://darklake.fi).

I've been writing code and building systems for over a decade. Started with [GIS](https://www.dpi.inpe.br/spring), computer vision for materials science, [biometrics](https://github.com/vitorpy/qwsqviewer), then built [Pillar](https://pillar.fi) (an Ethereum wallet that got some traction), and a bunch of other stuff that seemed interesting at the time. Basically every hard problem I could get my hands on.

These days I'm focused on privacy-preserving financial infrastructure. I believe in open source as the only sustainable way to build trustworthy systems - especially when handling people's money.

Born in Brazil, living in Poland, with stops in the United Kingdom and Ireland before here. Poland is home now though. I contribute to various open source projects and think the European approach to privacy and digital rights is worth defending with better technology.

I'm a fan of [Moxie Marlinspike](https://moxie.org)'s take: "In general, I hope to contribute to a world where we value skills and relationships over careers and titles."
