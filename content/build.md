title: "Built with Hugo"
---

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static site generator written in Go.

## Tech Stack

- **Generator**: Hugo {{< hugo-version >}}
- **Theme**: Custom minimal theme lightly based on [Zenburn](https://github.com/jnurmine/Zenburn)
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Chroma with zenburn theme
- **Fonts**: [Berkeley Mono](https://usgraphics.com/products/berkeley-mono) and FontAwesome

## Features

- No JavaScript (100% functional without JS)
- No tracking or analytics
- All first-party resources
- Single bundled CSS file (~6KB)
- Optimized fonts (FontAwesome subset)
- Automatic image optimization via Hugo's asset pipeline
- Full RSS feed support

## Performance

- Single CSS request
- Optimized font loading with preload hints
- Aggressive caching with fingerprinted assets

## Philosophy

This site follows a minimal, privacy-respecting approach. The entire site works perfectly with JavaScript disabled and loads in under a second on most connections.
